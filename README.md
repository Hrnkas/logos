# Logo Turtle

A simple Logo-like programming environment using Python and Pygame.

This project aims to create a basic turtle graphics environment where users can issue commands to move a "turtle" cursor on the screen, drawing lines as it moves. The turtle is visually represented by a triangle.

## Current Features
- A `Turtle` character that can be positioned and oriented on the screen.
- The turtle is rendered as a triangle.
- Basic Pygame window setup.

## Features (Planned)
- Line drawing based on turtle movement and pen state.
- More comprehensive turtle movement commands.
- User input for controlling the turtle.
- Color control for pen and turtle.

## Running the Project

1. Ensure you have Python installed.
2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   `python -m venv venv`
   `source venv/bin/activate`  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the main file: `python logo_turtle/main.py`
